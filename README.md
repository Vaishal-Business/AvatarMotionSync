# AvatarMotionSync

A project that integrates **MediaPipe** for real-time motion tracking with **Ready Player Me** avatars, creating an interactive experience where virtual avatars mimic real human movements.

## Features

- **Real-time motion tracking** using MediaPipe.
- **3D Avatar integration** via Ready Player Me.
- **Live movement synchronization** between the user and the avatar.
- **Customizable avatars** from Ready Player Me platform.
  
## Tech Stack

- **MediaPipe**: Used for detecting and tracking human body movements in real-time.
- **Ready Player Me**: A platform for creating 3D avatars that can be used in various applications.
- **Three.js (optional)**: For rendering the 3D avatar in a web environment.
- **React (optional)**: If you are building the frontend using React, though this could be adapted to other frameworks.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AvatarMotionSync.git
cd AvatarMotionSync
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Ready Player Me Avatar
1. Visit [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/).
2. Create or customize your 3D avatar by following the on-screen instructions.
3. Once your avatar is created, copy the avatar’s URL from the Ready Player Me dashboard.
4. You will use this URL in the project to load your custom avatar.


### 4. Running the Project
Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the project in your default browser. Make sure your camera is connected and that you've allowed permission for camera access.

Once the server is running, you will see your Ready Player Me avatar, which will move in sync with your real-time body movements tracked by MediaPipe.

### 5. MediaPipe Integration
MediaPipe will be used to capture live video input and track body points for real-time avatar synchronization. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure your webcam is connected and working properly.
2. When you launch the project, your browser will prompt you to allow camera access—make sure to grant permission.
3. MediaPipe will analyze your movements through the webcam and detect key points such as facial expressions, arm movements, and posture.
4. The detected motion data will be sent to the avatar, enabling it to mimic your movements in real-time.

## Usage

1. Open the project in your browser after running it.
2. Allow camera access when prompted.
3. Your Ready Player Me avatar will appear on the screen.
4. Move in front of the camera, and the avatar will mimic your real-time movements, tracked by MediaPipe.

## How It Works

- **MediaPipe** captures your body movements through the webcam, detecting facial landmarks and blendshapes.
- These movements are mapped to the skeleton of the Ready Player Me avatar, so the avatar moves in sync with you.
- MediaPipe runs efficiently in real-time, ensuring low-latency tracking for smooth avatar animations.
- **Ready Player Me** provides customizable avatars that can be integrated into various applications. You can select or create your avatar and then use the provided URL to load it into the project.
